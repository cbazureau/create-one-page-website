## Quick Overview

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node 14 or later version on your local development machine**. We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

```sh
npx create-one-page-website my-page
cd my-page
npm start
```

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles your static one-page and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your page is ready to be deployed.
